Topic 1: Statistics
--> Academic discipline dealing with all aspects of data.
Perspectives:
* Art of summarizing data e.g art of showing good plots
* Science of uncertainity (most information is uncertain)
* Science of decisions (people or machines can make decisions from data)
* Science of variations (summarizing data e.g taking averages, maximas, minimas) or central tedency of spread
* art of forecasting (Predicting future trends)
* Science of measurement and data collection

Topic 2: Foundations of data
	Source of data:
		-- Designed data - "artifically collected "
					(Surverys, studies etc)
		-- Organic data (process generated i.e data collected from real-world processes e.g sensors data, data of network packets )
					(sentiments analysis)

	which source used mostly: Organic is used as this data is accurate.

	For both of these data needs to be i.i.d
		"independent", "identically distributed"

Question: What is source of NHANES data?
Answer: Designed data because it is collected using Surverys.

Topic 3: Types of data
	-- Some data is not numeric!
		e.g race or gender

	-- Just as we have data types in programming languages, we have different types here.
	-- weight -- numeric, continuous
	-- # of kids ------ numeric, discrete (not 1.1 or 2.5 e.g number of childrens in a house)
	-- Age group (child, adult, elder) ------ Categorical, ordered
	-- Gender ----------Categorical, unordered (e.g we cannot say male is older than female and viceversa or we can't say male comes first and then female)

SO In computer everything will go as numbers and for our processing purpose we assign these numbers.
# For ordered values we can say child 0, adult 1, elder 2 (As values have order and our assignment 1,2,3 also has order so we are fine). 

# but for gender it can be represented as M/F.
				       or 0/1.
we can assign 65, 75 or whatever we want to M/F as their is no order.
But for computer their is an order here as so computer can Predict that small value gender has big height and large values gender has small height.

What we know, is that right what our computer Predicting?
No! we know that height has no connection with a person as male or female.
# Also whatif in future we says F will be labled as 1 and M as 0, model will break.
# Problem here is we cannot teach this to our computer i.e model.
# so we have to change this 0 and 1 so machine cannot compare these two.
Solution:
# we will create a vector M has 1 so it's first index (0) will be 1 and all others as 0 e.g M = [1 0] and F = [0 1]. this way we can make these seems computer to be totally independent.

ANother example races: B:0, W:1, H:2 so B = [1 0 0] W = [0 1 0] H = [0 0 1]
--> Now we cannot compare any two vectors and this representaion is known as "One hot vector representaion" as we make 1 as on and all other 0.
--> You can compare two vectors magnitude but as whole 2 values vectors are not comaparablee.g (2,2) < (3,2) WRONG
but we can say 3 < 4 RIGHT (magnitude of above vectors)

Summary: When u have unordered data make sure u make it unordered for machine as well using one hot vectors representaion.

--> Screenshot here.
As discrete and ordinal variable types both are discrete and ordered so what's difference:
In discrete average makes sense e.g number of kids in pakistan in a house on average are 2.5, fine but in Categorical case we cannot say what is average age group.
